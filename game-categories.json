If they only understoodHe would give it all up if he only couldOh, there's an empty place in my bonesThat calls out for something unknownThe fame and praise come year after yearDoes nothing for these empty tears",

I've been too close to seeThe answer's right in front of meRight in front of meIt's simple really, very clearLike music drifting in the airInvisible, but everywhereJust because I cannot see itDoesn't mean I can't believe itYou know, I think this Christmas thingIt's not as tricky as it seemsAnd why should they have all the fun?It should belong to anyoneNot anyone, in fact, but meWhy, I could make a Christmas treeAnd there's no reason I can findI couldn't handle Christmas timeI bet I could improve it tooAnd that's exactly what I'll doHee, hee, hee, hee!

I went and did my best!And, by God, I really tasted something swell!And for a moment, why, I even touched the sky!And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did!And for the first time since I don't remember whenI felt just like my old bony self again...And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King...That's right, I am the Pumpkin King! Aha, ha, ha!And I just can't wait until next Halloween'Cause I've got some new ideasThat will really make them scream!And, by God, I'm really gonna give it all my might!Uh oh, I hope there's still time to set things right!Sandy Claws, hmm...",

But, as seen throughout him growing up, he takes on the talents of other animals \u2013 the most notable being swinging on vines like a monkey. It also consists of the transition from 5 year old Tarzan to 20, and the evolution of his friends as well. Its about his journey of growing up and him becoming a man."

It is first sung by Mother Gothel to a flower at the beginning of the movie, causing the flower to glow and make Gothel young again. Like the flower, Rapunzel\u2019s hair glows when the song is sung. The song is taught to Rapunzel when she is older so she can sing it to heal Mother Gothel. It is later used by Rapunzel on Eugene after he cut his hand in a cave that he and Rapunzel were trapped in.\n\nAccording to Alan Menken, the composer of Tangled, this was the last song to be composed for the film."

Mirabel has just discovered the secret of Bruno\u2019s vision foretelling Mirabel playing a role in making or breaking the magic of Encanto. Augustin, Mirabel\u2019s father, asks Mirabel not to tell anyone this secret. However, Mirabel\u2019s cousin Dolores, who has the gift of super hearing, overhears the secret and struggles to keep it to herself during a family dinner where Isabela is expected to be proposed to by Mariano. This song plays as the secret is whispered down the dinner table between each family member. Chaos assumes, revealing their dysfunctional family, ultimately upsetting family matriarch Abuela Alma and ruining Isabel'a engagement."

Although he had everything his heart desired, the Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkindBut then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the Prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantressThe Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous Beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived thereAshamed of his monstrous form, the Beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside worldThe rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first year. If he could learn to love another and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a Beast for all timeAs the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hopeFor who could ever learn to love a Beast?",

For beauty is found within. When he dismissed her again, the old woman's outer appearance melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.\u200bThe prince begged for forgiveness, but it was too late. For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.\u200bAs punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there.\u200bAs day bled into years, the prince and his servants were forgotten by the world, for the enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved.\u200bBut the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose. If he could learn to love another and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.\u200bAs the years passed, he felt into despair and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast?",

It is sung by Alan Menken, the composer for both the 2017 and 1991 versions of the film. Whereas the final song is sung by the young prince and the castle staff, the original version was conceived as being sung by the Beast himself. In it, the Beast expresses his regret for the careless life he lived when he was human, and longs to find true love and become human again. Like the final version of the song, \u201cDays in the Sun\u201d has the same melody as the \u201cAria\u201d at the beginning of the film, likely to provide a contrast between the Prince\u2019s old, selfish life and his life of remorse under the curse."

Many are drawn beneath the surface, searching for riches, or glory, or answers to old secrets. Descend into Hallownest, traverse the depths, unravel its mysteries and conquer its evils.\n\nThe score for Hollow Knight captures the vast underground world of the game. The story begins with soft piano notes echoing the Hollow Knight theme, and as the player explores further, orchestral forces swell to an operatic scale as the fate of the knight unfolds.",

Am I not unique?\nMaybe I'm not here at all\nLook, the fakers, blinding us with lies\nThe breakers of us all\nOh, It's useless\nWhat could it mean that we're here?\nCan we make a difference\nIf we don't break out of here?\n\nWake up, get up, get out there\nRaise your voice against liars\nFeed your anger like fire\nWhy does nobody want change?\nJust imagine you're out there\nSwatting lies in the making\nCan't move fast without breaking\nIf you hold on, life won't change\nThe fakers are all sick at heart\nTheir faces hiding their fear\nThey look down on all the rest of us\nLike they're some special breed\nWho's the high lord?\nWho thinks he's better than us?\nAin't it a crime, that?\nIs there a mission for us?\nWho is that high lord?\nWho'd kill a million of us?\nAnd as the bell tolls\nIs there no remission for us?\n\nWake up, get up, get out there\nThere's more to life than their way\nIf you live, you cannot stay\nWhy does nobody want change?\nLet your voices ring out, yeah\nTake the mask off and be free\nFind yourself in the debris\nIf you hold on, life won't change\n\nWake up, get up, get out there\nRaise your voice against liars\nFeed your anger like fire\nWhy does nobody want change?\nJust imagine you're out there\nSwatting lies in the making\nCan't move fast without breaking\nIf you hold on, life won't changeYou might also like4Embed",

Maybe some genius will find them.",
